ANS=Website:

A website is a collection of related web pages
that are typically identified by a common domain 
name and published on at least one web server.
Examples include www.google.com and www.wikipedia.org.
Websites can contain various types of content, including text,
images, videos, and interactive elements.
Webpage:

A webpage is a single document or
page of content that can be viewed in a web browser.
Each webpage is part of a website and is usually written in HTML. 
Webpages can include text, images, videos, links to other pages, 
and other multimedia content.
Web Browser:

A web browser is a software application used to access and view 
websites and webpages on the Internet. Examples of web browsers
include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge.
Web browsers interpret HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web technologies
to display content to users.
Web Server:

A web server is a computer system that
 hosts websites and delivers web pages to users over 
 the Internet. When a user requests a webpage by entering 
a URL into a web browser, the web server processes this 
request and sends the appropriate webpage to the browser.
 Examples of web server software include Apache, Nginx, and 
 Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS).
HTML (HyperText Markup Language):

HTML is the standard markup language used to create
and design webpages. It provides the structure of a
webpage by using a system of tags and attributes to 
define elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, 
images, and other types of content. HTML is the foundation
of web content and is essential for creating webpages.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):

CSS is a stylesheet language used to describe the 
presentation and layout of a webpage. It works alongside 
HTML to control the visual appearance of elements on a webpage,
such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. CSS allows
developers to separate content (HTML) from design, making 
it easier to maintain and update the appearance of websites.
