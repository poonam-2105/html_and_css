Q9-=. In how many ways can a CSS be integrated as a web page?

ANS=

external css:

css rules are defined in a separate file with a .css extension.
The css file is linked to the html file using the <link> tag within the <head> section.
This method is useful for applying consistent styles across multiple pages.

nternal CSS:

css rules are defined within the <style> tag inside the <head> section of the HTML document.
This method is suitable for applying styles to a single document

Inline css:

css rules are applied directly to html elements using the style attribute.
This method is useful for applying unique styles to individual elements but is not recommended
for general use due to poor maintainability and separation of concerns.
